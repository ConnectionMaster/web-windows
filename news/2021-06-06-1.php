    <p>
      You may have already noticed that we didn't provide snapshot builds for
      PHP 8 for many months. There are no plans to change that, but users can
      get <a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/php-builder-windows">third
      party provided nighly builds</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will, of course, continue to provide Windows builds of all PHP
      (pre-)releases. So watch out for the release of PHP 8.1.0alpha1, scheduled
      for 10 Jun 2021!
