  <?php news_date('11-Oct-2021') ?>
  <div>
    <p>
      You may have noticed already that Windows DLLs are no longer available on
      <a href="https://pecl.php.net/">PECL</a>. Since the PHP for Windows team has no
      access to that machine to debug the problem, the best we could do is to file a
      <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81492">respective bug report</a>,
      and to hope that it will be fixed in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, we keep building and monitoring the build results of all PECL
      packages for Windows. And you can <a href="https://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/">
      download the DLLs from our server</a>. Sorry for the inconvenience!
    </p>
    <p>
      PS: this issue has been resolved!
