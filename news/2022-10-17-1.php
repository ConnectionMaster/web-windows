  <?php news_date('17-Oct-2022') ?>
  <div>
    <p>
      You may have already noticed that DLLs for new PECL releases are no longer
      available for several months. This is because the Windows PECL build machine
      died, and the team is still working on the long term plan of building DLLs for
      PECL extensions with a new CI process. We're doing our best to finish that as
      soon as possible, and keep you up to date.
