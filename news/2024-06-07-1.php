  <?php news_date('07-Jun-2024') ?>
  <div>
    <p>
	Windows DLLs for most PECL extensions are back! We have been working on an
	alternative way through GitHub Actions to automate the builds of these
	extensions, which means PECL DLLs are now available on the respective
	package's download page again.
	</p>
	<p>
	The next step is automating these builds so that extension authors can
	include steps in their release actions as well
